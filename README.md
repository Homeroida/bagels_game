# Bagels Game
This is a Python implementation of the "Bagels" game, a deductive logic game in which the player tries to guess a secret number that is randomly generated by the computer.

## Rules of the Game
The computer generates a secret number made up of three digits with no repeated digits.
The player has ten guesses to guess the secret number.
After each guess, the computer provides clues in the form of "Pico", "Fermi", or "Bagels":
"Pico" means that one digit is correct but in the wrong position.
"Fermi" means that one digit is correct and in the right position.
"Bagels" means that no digit is correct.
If the player correctly guesses the secret number, the game ends and the player wins. If the player uses up all ten guesses without guessing the secret number, the game ends and the player loses.
## Usage
To play the game, run the bagels.py file in a Python environment. The game will prompt the player to enter guesses, and provide clues after each guess. To exit the game, enter "no" when prompted to play again.
